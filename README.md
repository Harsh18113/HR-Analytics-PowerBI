ðŸ“Š Unveiling HR Analytics Dashboard with Power BI ðŸ“Š

I recently completed a project using Power BI to analyze employee attrition, and I'm excited to share some key insights.

My project statement was simple: understanding the factors driving employee attrition and providing actionable insights. The dashboard I created achieves this by visualizing key metrics like attrition rate (16.1%), average salary (6.5K), and tenure (7 years).

Dashboard Components and Explanation:
1. Top-Level KPIs:

Count of Employee (1470): The total number of employees in the dataset. This provides context for the other metrics.

Attrition (237): The number of employees who have left the company. This is the primary metric being analyzed.

Attrition Rate (16.1%): The percentage of employees who left, calculated as (Attrition / Count of Employee) * 100. This is a crucial indicator of the severity of the attrition problem.

Avg Age (37): The average age of employees, which might be correlated with attrition. Younger employees might be more likely to leave for better opportunities.

Avg Salary (6.5K): The average salary of employees. Low salaries are often a major factor in attrition.

Avg Years (7.0): The average tenure of employees, indicating how long employees typically stay with the company.

2. Filters:

Human Resources, Research & Development, Sales: These department filters allow users to see how attrition varies across different departments. This helps identify departments with higher attrition rates and investigate potential causes.

3. Charts and Visualizations:

Attrition by Gender: A bar chart showing the number of male and female employees who left. This helps determine if gender plays a role in attrition.

Attrition by Education: A pie chart showing the distribution of attrition across different education fields (e.g., Life Sciences, Medical, Marketing). This helps understand if education level or field influences attrition.

Attrition by Age: A bar chart showing the distribution of attrition across different age groups. This helps identify age ranges with higher attrition rates.

Attrition by Salary Slab: A bar chart showing attrition across different salary ranges. This is crucial for understanding the impact of salary on attrition.

Attrition by Years at Company: A line chart showing attrition over time (years of employment). This helps identify tenure periods with higher attrition.

Attrition by Job Role (Table and Bar Chart): A table and bar chart showing the number of attritions in each job role. This helps pinpoint specific roles with high turnover.

This dashboard demonstrates the power of data visualization in identifying trends and informing strategic decisions. hashtag#PowerBI hashtag#DataAnalytics hashtag#HRAnalytics hashtag#EmployeeAttrition hashtag#DataVisualization
